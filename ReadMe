Documentation of the tool can be found at:

http://dryvr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

We also put the Html files of the documents on the Desktop in the Docs folder  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folders:

DryVR is put on the Desktop in the folder DryVR

Inside DryVR folder, the inputFile folder contains all the input files, the output folder contains
all intermediate results and reachtubes, the rest folders contain the models and auxiliary files.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Get started for artifact evaluation
========================================
We create a script to evaluate all the examples automatically in the inputFile folder. Please open DryVR folder and run 

./runThis.sh

You should expect ~40 mins to finish all the examples.
-------------------------------------------------------------
To run separate examples in the inputFile folder, please run 

python main.py inputFile/[input_file]

for example:

python main.py inputFile/input_AEB

The examples descriptions can be found in the documentation. Please note that as the verification algorithm uses probabilistic method, the verification result may vary for different runs.
------------------------------------------------------------

To plot the reachtube, please run:

python tubePlotter.py [dimension Number]

for example:

python tubePlotter.py 1

Note that dimension 0 is the local time for each mode and last dimension is the global time. 
When the system is Unsafe or Unknown, please do not use the plotter. Otherwise, it will break or plot the result for the last example.
